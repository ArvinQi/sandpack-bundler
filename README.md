# Sandpack Bundler

The sandpack bundler, this aims to eventually replace the current sandpack with a more streamlined and way faster version.

## Trying it out

The `main` branch of this repository is automatically deployed to `https://sandpack-next.pages.dev/` so you can update `bundlerURL` of `sandpack-react` to that url and start using the new sandpack bundler.

## Usage

Run `yarn start` and navigate to `http://localhost:1234/?sandbox-id=37mwp`
