# Sandpack Bundler

The sandpack bundler, this aims to eventually replace the current sandpack with a more streamlined and faster version.

## Getting started

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
2. Run `yarn start` to start the development server
3. Set the `bundlerURL` of sandpack-react to `http://localhost:1234/` to see it in action.

## Using the deployed version

The `main` branch of this repository is automatically deployed to `https://sandpack-next.pages.dev/` so you can update `bundlerURL` of `sandpack-react` to that url and start using the new sandpack bundler.
